	<h2>Welcome to the MetaLang official site!</h2>
	<pre>
	We hope you enjoy your stay on the site and that you may find what you were looking for,
	be it documentation, binaries or even the source code.

	I, Deavmi, am trying to create a very awesome and fun programming language implemented in... bash.
	I want to create something different, something that someone hasn't already made and also have lots
	of fun in the process of developing the project.
	Hopefully it will teach me lots of bash (as bash is a very hard to master language as it has a very man
	constructs available but one must know whe to use these	constructs).

	So please join in on the journey and try something new out called MetaLang.

	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	<p>The documentation for the MetaLang programming language can be found <a href="docs/">here</a>.</p>
	<p>We recommend you begin by reading the <a href="docs/metalang-in-a-nutshell.html">"MetaLang in a nutSHell"</a> document first as it is very important prior to learning a <i>"hybrid"</i> language (this term explained too).</p>
